# MLOPSIFY

## Introduction
This project is designed to predict product review scores based on product descriptions. 
It follows MLOps best practices, leveraging MLflow for experiment tracking, FastAPI for building a prediction server, and Google Cloud Run for deployment.

## Problem Statement
customer reviews play a crucial role in influencing purchasing decisions. However, many products receive limited or no reviews, making it difficult to assess their quality. 
This project aims to bridge that gap by predicting product review scores based on product descriptions. By leveraging machine learning and MLOps best practices, this solution enables businesses to estimate customer sentiment even before reviews are posted.
